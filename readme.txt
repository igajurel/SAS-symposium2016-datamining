Title Of Paper
Exploring the Factors that Impact Injury Severity using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)

Abstract
Injury Severity describes the severity of the injury to the person involved in the crash. Understanding the factors that influence injury severity can be helpful in designing mechanisms to reduce accident fatalities. In this research, we model and analyze the data as a hierarchy with three levels to answer the question what road, vehicle and driver-related factors influence injury severity. In this study, we used hierarchical linear model (HLM), for analyzing nested data from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). The results show that driver-related factors are directly related to injury severity. On the other hand, road conditions and vehicle characteristics have significant moderation impact on injury severity. We believe that our study has important policy implications for designing customized mechanisms specific to each hierarchical level to reduce the occurrence of fatal accidents.
